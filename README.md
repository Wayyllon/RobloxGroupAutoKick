# RobloxGroupAutoKick
A simple Python script which automatically kicks players from a roblox group.

**NOTE:**
! This script has limitations, if you are using it to automatically delete posts by the user, it will only check 100 posts back, if their post is more than 100 posts old it will not be deleted by the script.
! I'm not an expert, & this script is probably inefficient as fuck, but it works.

SETUP:

**Install python, preferably the latest version, from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/**

**In a command prompt, type in the following:** *"pip install requests"* **& press enter.**

*In some cases python doesnt correctly install pip, you're on your own for that one, try looking around on the internet.*

**Download main.py, & place it in a spot you wont delete it, (not downloads)**

**Open main.py in notepad, & modify the variables, starting at line 5 & ending at line 10.**

**To get your roblox cookie, go to the roblox website, right click anywhere on the page, click inspect, in the tab that pops open, locate storage, click that tab, & copy the value for "ROBLOSECURITY, & paste it into the quotes for the 'Cookies' variable."**

**After that, just go back to file explorer, & run the file with python.**
